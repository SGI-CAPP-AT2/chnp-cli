# Code Highlight n Print Command Line Interface

## What is it?
CHNP (Code highlight and print) which is the project I developed in my first year of Diploma for the purpose of code printing where I can use a certain format to create a PDF from my code and it's output.
It was helpful throughout my diploma where I have to submit prints of my code.
You can checkout that repo [here](https://github.com/SGI-CAPP-AT2/code-highlight-n-print)

## What is CHNP Cli?
CHNP is an webapp where I have to copy my code and paste which is very hard to manage in case we've multiple codes for same practical/experiments.
You've to copy them one by one and paste them there.
So, to tackle this problem and make tool more convenient I developed a Command Line application in Nodejs.

## How it works?

![Working of CHNP Cli](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vjxgkayixv1c95i9itbi.jpg)
CHNP Cli has following major components :

1.Session Object: This is where all of your codes and settings for current working directory is stored. (A Json File)
2.Commands: Currently there are 2 commands [details](https://sgi-capp-at2.github.io/chnp-cli/help/commands.html)
 1. cohl: It is for operations like exporting or printing the session object i.e. it only reads the session objects.
 2. cohls: It is for operations like editing your style preferences, staging codes for printing and many more i.e. for editing session object
 
3.Operators: These are the always first arguments passed to commands like to perform add operation we'll use `add` operator. [details](https://sgi-capp-at2.github.io/chnp-cli/help/operators.html)

CHNP Cli uses Nodejs as runtime 
### Installation 
#### Prerequisites
Nodejs is only Prerequisites you have to install
You can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en)
#### Install
After Installing the Nodejs you will type following command into terminal in any directory.
```
npm install -g chnp-cli
```
This will install the CHNP-Cli 

## How to use it ?
#### STEP 1: Create Session Object
Always you've to create session object so to do that you can use following command
```
cohls create "<MyObjectName>""
```
#### STEP 2: Sepcify file name
Cohls will ask you for filename enter like following
```
cohls create "JavaSessionObject"
Enter filename while adding: $1.java
```
here $1 will be replaced with 2nd arg passed while `add` operator because 1st arg will alway be the `add` operator.
#### STEP 3: Specify Commands
To Execute Source Code of java we require 2 commands usually which are `javac` and `java`.
So, Specify Them As Follows
```
$ cohls create "JavaSessionObject"
Enter filename while adding: $1.java
Enter commands to run program while adding: 
1. > javac $1.java
2. > java $1
3. > 

```
Now whenever we've to stage a java file we can use following command
```
$ cohls add App
```
Source Code file will be `App.java` which will produce `App.class` and wil execute it.
#### STEP 4: Specify your watermark
Like
```
$ cohls create "JavaSessionObject"
Enter filename while adding: $1.java
Enter commands to run program while adding: 
1. > javac $1.java
2. > java $1
3. > 
Enter watermark for your codes: CODE_BY_SHUBHAM
Operation is SUCCESSFULL
```
#### STEP 5: Add a Java File
You can add your file by using `add` operator
```
cohls add App.java
<
YOUR CODE EXECUTION WILL BE HERE
>
OPERATION IS SUCCESSFUL 
```

## Wrapping Up
You can use this project for printing your codes with output.
